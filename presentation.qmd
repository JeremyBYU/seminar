# What is AI to you?

- What comes to your mind when you hear the term 'Artificial Intelligence'?
- Books, Movies, Songs...Experiences?


# Examples to Me

- HAL 9000 (2001: A Space Odyssey)
- Skynet (Terminator)
- Ultron (Marvel Series)
- Agents (Matrix)
- Samantha (Her)


# Definitions

- **Artificial** - Made by humans, not occurring in nature.
- **Intelligence** -  Acquire and apply knowledge and skills.
- **Artificial Intelligence:** the *simulation* of intelligence in machines that are programmed to problem-solve like humans.
- This is super broad, lets dig into some specific subfields to narrow down our discussion.



# Subfields of AI

- **Machine Learning:** Algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions based on data.
- **Computer Vision:** Interpret and understand visual information from the world.
- **Robotics:** Integration of AI and physical machines, allowing robots to perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Understand, interpret, and generate human language.



# The rise of Large Language Models

- **Before** - Come up with very complicated rules and algorithms that express language and thought.
- **Now** - Just predict the next worx using statistics
  - This is called a **generative** model and are the most difficult models to create because you need an enormous amount of data and large computers.
- What changed? Where did the data come from? Where did the computation come from?

# ChatGPT

- Released at the end of 2022 by OpenAI.
- Who has experience with it?
- How do you use it?
- Does anyone think it has human like intelligence?


# ChatGPT (GPT4)

- Mastery of natural language. Generate fluent and coherent text
- Summarizing and answering broad questions
- Reasoning in mathematics and logic
- Understanding humans with common sense

# Intelligence

- What is intelligence to you?

# Grading Intelligence

- **Creative Reasoning** -  **identify** arguments, intermediate steps, or calculations that are relevant at each stage on a path towards a solution. 
- **Technical Proficiency** - **perform** routine calculations that are prescribed at each step.
- **Critical Reasoning** - **examine** each step and break it down to its sub components. Ability to backtrack.

# Examples

All of these example were taken from a recent paper by Microsoft AI, "Sparks of Artificial Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4".

# Example 1 - Prompt

> Here we have a book, 9 eggs, a laptop, a bottle and a nail.Please tell me how to stack them on to each other in a stable manner.

# Example 1 - Response

:::{.smaller}

Book, eggs arranged as square, laptop, bottle, nail.

# Example 2 - Follow Up

- Should note that further mathematical probing on this question failed. GPT4 gave invalid proofs. But they *seemed* convincing.

# Interaction with Humans

- **Theory of Mind** - attribute mental states such as beliefs, emotions, desires, intentions, and knowledge to oneself and ot others. 
- Reflecting on someone elses mental state
- Reflecting on someones reflection of someones elses mental state.

# Example 3 - Interaction with Humans



# Sentience and AI
- **Definition of Sentience:** The capacity to have subjective experiences and feelings.
- Discuss the philosophical and ethical implications of AI achieving sentience.
- Highlight current debates on AI ethics and consciousness.

---

# The Turing Test
- **Explanation of the Turing Test:** A test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human.
- Discuss its relevance in the context of modern AI.
- Consider criticisms and limitations of the Turing Test.

---

# Large Language Models
- **Definition of Large Language Models (LLMs):** Sophisticated AI models trained on vast amounts of text data, capable of generating human-like text.
- Discuss the impact of LLMs on natural language understanding and generation.
- Mention examples like OpenAI's GPT-3 and its applications.
