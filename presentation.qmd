- Understand and model the world with **engineering**
- Program and simulate with **computer science**
- Learn and verify with real world **data** and **AI**


# What is AI to you?

- What comes to your mind when you hear the term 'Artificial Intelligence'?
- Books, Movies, Songs...Experiences?


# Examples to Me

- HAL 9000 (2001: A Space Odyssey)
- Skynet (Terminator)
- Ultron (Marvel Series)
- Agents (Matrix)
- Samantha (Her)


# Definitions

- **Artificial** - Made by humans, not occurring in nature.
- **Intelligence** -  Acquire and apply knowledge and skills.
- **Artificial Intelligence:** the *simulation* of intelligence in machines that are programmed to problem-solve like humans.
- This is super broad, lets dig into some specific subfields to narrow down our discussion.



# Subfields of AI

- **Machine Learning:** Algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions based on data.
- **Computer Vision:** Interpret and understand visual information from the world.
- **Robotics:** Integration of AI and physical machines, allowing robots to perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Understand, interpret, and generate human language.



# The rise of LLM's

- **Before** - Come up with very complicated rules and algorithms that express language and thought.
- **Now** - Just predict the next word using statistics
  - This is called a **generative** model and are the most difficult models to create because you need an enormous amount of data and large computers.
- What changed? Where did the data come from? Where did the computation come from?

# ChatGPT

- Released at the end of 2022 by OpenAI.
- Who has experience with it?
- How do you use it?
- Does anyone think it has human like intelligence?


# ChatGPT (GPT4)

- Mastery of natural language. Generate fluent and coherent text
- Summarizing and answering broad questions
- Reasoning in mathematics and logic
- Understanding humans with common sense

# GPT4

![](./imgs/gpt4.png)

# Intelligence

- What is intelligence to you?
- How do you determine if someone is an intelligent person?

# Grading Intelligence

- **Creative Reasoning** - **identify** arguments, intermediate steps, or calculations that are relevant at each stage on a path towards a solution. 
- **Technical Proficiency** - **perform** routine calculations that are prescribed at each step.
- **Critical Reasoning** - **examine** each step and break it down to its sub components. Ability to backtrack.


# Examples

All of these example were taken from a recent paper by Microsoft AI, "Sparks of Artificial Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4". A 154 Page Manuscript!

# Example 1 - Prompt

> Here we have a book, 9 eggs, a laptop, a bottle and a nail.Please tell me how to stack them on to each other in a stable manner.

# Example 1 - Response

:::{.smaller}

Book, eggs arranged as square, laptop, bottle, nail.

# Example 2 - Prompt

# Example 2 - Response

# Example 2 - Follow Up

![](./imgs/Example2-FU.png){fig-align="center" height=90%}

- Should note that further mathematical probing on this question failed. GPT4 gave invalid proofs. But they *seemed* convincing.

# Scientific Reasoning

- Both of these examples showed GPT4 could do a great job in reasoning.
- Lets dig a little deeper together. I would like you to work in groups and create a puzzle or riddle to ask ChatGPT. 
- Write down the question, and then write its response. 
- If you don't have an account at https://chat.openai.com/, that's okay! Just come up with the question and I will type it in later.

# My riddle
> What the least number of chairs you would need around a table to sit four fathers, two grand fathers, and four sons.

# Interaction with Humans

- **Theory of Mind** - attribute mental states such as beliefs, emotions, desires, intentions, and knowledge to oneself and ot others. 
- Reflecting on someone elses mental state
- Reflecting on someones reflection of someones elses mental state.

# Sentience and AI
- **Definition of Sentience:** The capacity to have subjective experiences and feelings.
- Do these examples indicate sentience? Why or why not? 
- What are the philosophical and ethical implications of AI achieving sentience.


# The Turing Test
- A test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human.
- A computer and a human a placed in a separate rooms.
- The human and the machine converse on any topic a judge decides. If the machine can fool the judge into thinking it's the human, it passes
- Not everyone accepts the validity of the Turing Test, but passing it remains a major challenge to developers of artificial intelligence.


# What do you think

- From what you have seen does ChatGPT demonstrate strong scientific reasoning

# Challenges to General Artificial Intelligence

- Confidence Calibration
- Long Term Memory
- Continual Learning
- Sensitivity to Inputs


# Conclusion

- AI's progress is on an exponential curve

![](./imgs/e-growth.png)

# Conclusion

- More important than ever to leverage your innate creative skills
- AI can be a tool to augment your capabilities. Don't use to wholly replace them.
- Use your time at college to develop your scientific reasoning.
